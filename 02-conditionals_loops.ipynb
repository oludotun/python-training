    "The concept of file encoding deserves a few notes. In general, encoding defines how the information in the file is interpreted by the computer. In order for the information  to be interpreted correctly, the encoding setting must match to the encoding which was used when creating the file in the first place. If the encoding is left unspecified, the system default will be used. In case the system default does not match the file encoding, the contents may be interpreted incorrectly, or there may be an error and contents will not be read at all. Anyone working with data, especially in languages other than English, will encounter this situation sooner or later. The problem is that text files, including CSV, do not always store the encoding specification internally, as part of the file. In such case, the user must figure out the right encoding from context (such as metadata, if any), or through trial and error. "

    "[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) is the most widely used file encoding when working with data. All CSV sample data files we use in this book are encoded in UTF-8. The difference between `'utf-8'` or `'utf-8-sig'` is that the latter specifies the input file has a [Byte Order Mark (BOM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) signature, namely `\\ufeff`. The BOM is omitted from the result when the right encoding is specified in `open`. For example, try opening the file connection with `open('data/gtfs/stops.txt',encoding='utf-8')`, then inspecting the contents of the first line (see below). You should see `\\ufeff` at the beginning of the string. "

Iterators are also iterable, meaning that you can over them in a loop, but they are stateful (e.g., they remember which item was obtained using `next`), meaning that you can go over them just once. For example, file reader objects, such as the ones created with `csv.DictReader` (see {ref}`reading-csv-files`), are iterators.\n",
